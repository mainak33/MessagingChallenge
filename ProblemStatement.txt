Programming Challenge Problem Statement: 

Instructions
•	Please assume that:
o	All messages are sent and received as a stream of binary data, with each byte containing 8 bits of message content.  Bits are sent/received from MSB to LSB. 
o	All message fields are in Network Byte Order.  The code should be agnostic to endianness.
•	Please submit your header and source files only, plus the execution result print-out.  Please do not submit your executable, project files, etc.

1.	A hypothetical protocol used to communicate with UAVs has the following common fields:
Bits	Field
16	Message ID
8	Sender ID
8	Receiver ID
32	Payload Length
Variable	Payload

Implement a C++ class that can be used as the base class to develop specific messages later.  This class should have the following features:
•	Initialization of common fields.
•	Access method for each and every common field.
•	A virtual Send function that returns a string containing the message to be sent.
•	A virtual Receive function that accepts a string containing the message received, and populates the values of the common fields.

2.	Implement a C++ class using the base class above to process a message with the following payload:
Bits	Field
1	Lights
1	Camera
6	Action
64	Name

This class should have the following features:
•	Inherits the base class in Problem #1.
•	Initialization of all payload fields.
•	Access method for each and every payload field.
•	A Send function that returns a string containing the message to be sent.
•	A Receive function that accepts a string containing the message received, and populate the values of the payload fields.

3.	Write a unit test framework to verify your implementation above.  Use your engineering judgment on the scope of your test cases.  A text print-out should be produced for the result of each test case.
